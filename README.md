# Moodify
**Moodify** is a website that suggest music *in  accordance to the weather*. Weather affects your mood. We often feel sad, or emotional when it’s raining; energetic or excited when it’s sunny. So does music. We listen to upbeat songs when it’s sunny and moody ones when it’s raining,... the list goes on. So why not combining these two factors that when your mood (hence the name “mood-ify”) came in, the music list has already been planned out for you?
